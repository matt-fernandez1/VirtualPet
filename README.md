# VirtualPet

VIRTUAL PET 

In this project we created a virtual pet program that is similar to a Tomagotchi in that the user interacts with the program in order to satisfy the pet.

The pet that I created is Barry the Blowfish. Barry can be fed by the user, given water, and played with when he is bored. Barry responds to user inputs and responds how he is feeling.
